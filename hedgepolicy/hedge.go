// HedgePolicy is a policy that performes additional executions if the initial execution is slow to complete. This policy
// differs from RetryPolicy since multiple hedged execution may be in progress at the same time. By default, any
// outstanding hedges are canceled after the first execution result or error returns. The CancelOn and CancelIf methods
// can be used to configure a hedge policy to cancel after different results, errors, or conditions. Once the max hedges
// have been started, they are left to run until a cancellable result is returned, then the remaining hedges are
// canceled.
//
// If the execution is configured with a Context, a child context will be created for the execution and canceled when the
// HedgePolicy is exceeded.
//
// This type is concurrency safe.
