/*
RateLimiter is a Policy that can control the rate of executions as a way of preventing system overload.

There are two types of rate limiting: smooth and bursty. NewSmooth rate limiting will evenly spread out execution requests
over-time, effectively smoothing out uneven execution request rates. NewBursty rate limiting allows potential bursts of
executions to occur, up to a configured max per time period.

Rate limiting is based on permits, which can be requested in order to perform rate limited execution. Permits are
automatically refreshed over time based on the rate limiter's configuration.

This type provides methods that block while waiting for permits to become available, and also methods that return
immediately. The blocking methods include:

  - AcquirePermit
  - AcquirePermits
  - AcquirePermitWithMaxWait
  - AcquirePermitsWithMaxWait

The methods that return immediately include:

  - TryAcquirePermit
  - TryAcquirePermits
  - ReservePermit
  - ReservePermits
  - TryReservePermit
  - TryReservePermits

This type provides methods that return ErrExceeded when permits cannot be acquired, and also methods that
return a bool. The Acquire methods all return ErrExceeded when permits cannot be acquired, and the TryAcquire
methods return a boolean.

The ReservePermit methods attempt to reserve permits and return an expected wait time before the permit can be used.
This helps integrate with scenarios where you need to wait externally.

R is the execution result type. This type is concurrency safe.
